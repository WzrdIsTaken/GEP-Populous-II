A small data driven vertical slice of the game Populous II, created with an Entity Component System in DirectX11 & C++ for the Year 2 Game Engine Programming Module.

This assignment was completed in a team of five. My primary responsibilities were the backend ECS and Driver, core systems such as collision, rendering and data driving the game through external files, as well as some gameplay elements for example unit interactions and pathfinding. 

This project was very challenging as we had to not only use DirectX, a framework we had never used before, but also were ambitious and used an Entity Component System - again, something we had never done. However, I think I am now a better programmer because of it and am looking forward to using the data oriented paradigm again!
